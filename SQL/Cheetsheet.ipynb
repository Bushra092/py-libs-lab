    "* **WHERE**: Filter rows based on conditions.\n",
    "  Example: `WHERE salary > 50000;`\n",

    "  Example: `ORDER BY hire_date DESC;`\n",

    "  * `IN`: Match values from a list → `WHERE city IN ('Delhi', 'Mumbai')`\n",
    "  * `BETWEEN`: Filter within a range → `WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 35`\n",
    "  * `LIKE`: Pattern match → `WHERE name LIKE 'A%'`\n",
    "  * `IS NULL`: Check for missing values → `WHERE phone IS NULL`"

    "  * `COUNT()` – count rows\n",

    "  * `MIN()` – smallest value\n",
    "  * `MAX()` – largest value\n",
    "* **GROUP BY**: Combine rows with same values in a column.\n",
    "  Example: `SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;`\n",
    "* **HAVING**: Filter groups after aggregation.\n",
    "  Example: `HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;`\n",
