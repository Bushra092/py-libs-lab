    Data visualization bridges the gap between numbers and words by providing visual context to information.

    It helps identify and infer trends, patterns, correlations, and outliers in data.
    Various Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are essential tools for data visualization.

    Visual analytics enable efficient communication of insights to management, clients, and customers.

Matplotlib
    Matplotlib is a fundamental Python library for data visualization, allowing the creation of various chart types such as bar, area, line, scatter, pie, and box plots.
    
    Data is often converted from dictionaries to pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation and plotting with matplotlib.

    The integration of NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib forms the core workflow for data analytics and visualization in Python.
    
    Visualization techniques are essential for analyzing data and presenting insights effectively, especially when preparing reports or dashboards.
